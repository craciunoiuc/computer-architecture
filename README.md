# Computer Architecture Assignments
Each assignment was implemented in a different programming language.
The homework featured different aspects which will be listed below.
More details about each assignment will be in their folder.

Producer-Consumer (1)
---------------------
The assignment was fully completed.
The premise was to implement the producer-consumer paradigm in Python 3.
The code implementation was supposed to be as elegant as possible.

Code Optimisation (2)
---------------------
The assignment was fully completed.
The premise was to implement matrix multiplication in C through different methods.
Afterwards, the code had to be optimised as much as possible through different methods (imported library, by hand, -O3, additional flags).

GPU Hashtable (3)
-----------------
The assignment was fully completed.
The premise was to implement a hashtable that runs on the GPU in the CUDA C++ language.
The students were free to choose what implementation they wanted for the hashtable.
A direct approach was attempted and succeded through Linear Probing.
